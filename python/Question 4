 What is <Yield> Keyword in Python?

A) The <yield> keyword in Python can turn any function into a generator. Yields work like a standard return keyword.

But itâ€™ll always return a generator object. Also, a function can have multiple calls to the <yield> keyword.

Example:

def testgen(index):
weekdays = ['sun','mon','tue','wed','thu','fri','sat']
yield weekdays[index]
yield weekdays[index+1]
day = testgen(0)
print next(day), next(day)
Output: sun mon
